# google-tasks-desktop

There currently is no standalone application/website for Google Tasks, and the only way to access it is through the sidebar of Gmail/Google Calendar/etc. This is a simple Electron app (overkill i know) that loads Google Calendar and hides everything except Google Tasks in the sidebar. May break at any point if Google changes anything.

## Usage

First install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the app:

```bash
npm start
```

You can also build an executable:
```bash
npm run build
```
